              to which it characterizes current research is unknown. We
              conducted replications of 100 experimental and correlational
              studies published in three psychology journals using high-powered
              designs and original materials when available. Replication
              effects were half the magnitude of original effects, representing
              a substantial decline. Ninety-seven percent of original studies
              had statistically significant results. Thirty-six percent of
              replications had statistically significant results; 47\% of
              original effect sizes were in the 95\% confidence interval of the
              replication effect size; 39\% of effects were subjectively rated
              to have replicated the original result; and if no bias in
              original results is assumed, combining original and replication
              results left 68\% with statistically significant effects.
              Correlational tests suggest that replication success was better
              predicted by the strength of original evidence than by
              characteristics of the original and replication teams.",

  abstract     = "Transparency is essential for scientific progress. Access to
                  underlying data and materials allows us to make progress
                  through new discoveries and to better evaluate reported
                  findings, which increases trust in science. However, there
                  are challenges to changing norms of scientific practice.
                  Culture change is a slow process because of inertia and the
                  fear of unintended consequences. One barrier to change that
                  we encounter as we advocate to journals for more data sharing
                  is an editor's uncertainty about how their publisher will
                  react to such a change. Will they help implement that policy?
                  Will they discourage it because of uncertainty about how it
                  might affect submission numbers or citation rates? With
                  uncertainty, inaction seems to be easier. One way for a
                  publisher to overcome that barrier for individual journals is
                  to establish data sharing policies that are available to all
                  of their journals. That directly signals that the publisher

               archaeology, yet their role in the analytical pipeline is rarely
               exposed for other researchers to inspect or reuse. This limits
               the progress of archaeology because researchers cannot easily
               reproduce each other's work to verify or extend it. Four general
               principles of reproducible research that have emerged in other
               fields are presented. An archaeological case study is described
               that shows how each principle can be implemented using freely
               available software. The costs and benefits of implementing
               reproducible research are assessed. The primary benefit, of
               sharing data in particular, is increased impact via an increased
               number of citations. The primary cost is the additional time
               required to enhance reproducibility, although the exact amount

               digitization.? Digitization, in a fully digital paradigm, refers
               to practices that leverage advances in onsite, image-based
               modeling and volumetric recording, integrated databases, and
               data sharing. Such practices were implemented in 2014 during the
               inaugural season of the Kaymak{\c c}? Archaeological Project
               (KAP) in western Turkey. The KAP recording system, developed
               from inception before excavation as a digital workflow,
               increases accuracy and efficiency as well as simplicity and
               consistency. The system also encourages both practical and
               conceptual advances in archaeological practice. These involve
               benefits associated with thinking volumetrically, rather than in
               two dimensions, and a connectivity that allows for group
               decision-making regardless of group location. Additionally, it
               is hoped that the system's use of almost entirely

               concepts such as the ``data deluge'' suggest that modern

               archaeological datasets are few and far between, pointing to low

               application of computer-assisted text analysis. Missing data in

               insidious due to their concealed nature, leading to poor
               outcomes in terms of (re)use. Consequently, the degree of data

                 (FAIMS) project over the course of developing open-source
                 software for archaeologists. open-source software development,
                 which excels at coordinating discrete contributions from many
                 people and organisations, ooers the best hope for producing
                 complex and expensive tools in a discipline where resources
                 are limited. Over the course of this project, we have come to
                 realise that open-source approaches have applications in
                 archaeological research beyond the development of software
                 itself. The development of redeployable eld recording systems,
                 which must be exible and robust in order to accommodate the
                 diversity of archaeological data, represent one such
                 application. FAIMS project software facilitates this type of
                 development by separating the (large and complicated)
                 application code from the (relatively simple and largely
                 human-readable) document les that customise the application
                 for use by a particular project. Distributed version control
                 systems like GitHub, which are already being used for texts
                 and documents beyond code, provide a capable platform for
                 coordinating peer production of these deenition documents.
                 FAIMS has used GitHub successfully for its internal
                 development of early-adopter eld projects over the last year,
                 demonstrating its potential. Just as open-source approaches
                 have improved software by bringing the insights of an entire
                 community to bear on diicult problems, eld recording
                 systems-as well as the methods and approaches they embody also
                 beneet from the transparency provided by wide distribution and

                 platform that can be customized for diverse archaeological

                 adapting FAIMS software to projects in Turkey, Malawi, and
                 Peru, highlighting three themes: (1) the transition from paper

                 (2) the transition involves decisions and tradeoffs that

  abstract = "The replication crisis facing the psychological sciences is
              widely regarded as rooted in methodological or statistical
              shortcomings. We argue that a large part of the problem is the
              lack of a cumulative theoretical framework or frameworks. Without
              an overarching theoretical framework that generates hypotheses
              across diverse domains, empirical programs spawn and grow from
              personal intuitions and culturally biased folk theories. By
              providing ways to develop clear predictions, including through
              the use of formal modelling, theoretical frameworks set
              expectations that determine whether a new finding is
              confirmatory, nicely integrating with existing lines of research,
              or surprising, and therefore requiring further replication and
              scrutiny. Such frameworks also prioritize certain research foci,
              motivate the use diverse empirical approaches and, often, provide
              a natural means to integrate across the sciences. Thus,
              overarching theoretical frameworks pave the way toward a more
              general theory of human behaviour. We illustrate one such a
              theoretical framework: dual inheritance theory.",

               definitions of important concepts in terms of the properties of
               the phenomena under discussion and the goes we wish to achieve.
               If we recognize these weaknesses we can remedy them by devising
               and implementing well-defined experiments or observational
               studies. The title of this seminar contains five crucial

                  to support decisions ranging from real-time operations to
                  long-term planning. Data are routinely collected to monitor
                  infrastructure conditions and identify maintenance
                  priorities, and a wide range of environmental data are
                  collected to characterize habitat conditions, monitor fish
                  and wildlife populations, and support ecosystem restoration
                  programs. Scientists, engineers, and technicians are
                  increasingly using mobile devices such as tablets and
                  smartphones to record measurements, document site locations
                  via GPS, and take photos and notes in the field. Numerous
                  apps are already available to support general data

                  example, most existing apps are unable to interface with

               intrigued scholars in numerous disciplines for many years. In
               view of this interest it is useful now to assess current
               archaeological theories of change. In my view, our theory on
               change is weak because we have not made necessary operational
               definitions of important concepts in terms of the properties of
               the phenomena under discussion and the goes we wish to achieve.
               If we recognize these weaknesses we can remedy them by devising
               and implementing well-defined experiments or observational
               studies. The title of this seminar contains five crucial
               concepts: explanation, prehistory, culture, change and models.
               The remarks that follow consider each concept in turn.",
